<p>People typically add their degrees after their name. It&rsquo;s a way to show
their achievements and they are usually proud of it. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in.<br>
&ndash; Leonardo da Vinci</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Programming has always intrigued me. Owing to mediocre results in the admission exam,
I was not given the option to choose CSE as a major.
A teacher of mine advised me to take Statistics.
Now I see that maybe that was the best thing that happened to me.</p>
<p>Blessings come in various forms. Me getting introduced to R could be one
of them. During the early days, Python was more
favorable to me. But ever since I was introduced to Shiny, R Packages &amp; the wonderful
R community, the plot changed.</p>
<p>This undeserving minion has always been favored with blessings of which he is unworthy. It was during my University days that the thought occured to me; The world that
we see is just part of it. There&rsquo;s more to it, a lot more. Here,
<strong>success</strong> is defined by degrees, position, money and stuff.<br>
A man is measured by these trivial things. But these things can never define man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man&rsquo;s measure is his will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Towards the end of 3rd year, I had grown quite fond of R. This is when I started working
with Shiny. After days of work, my <a href = " https://shahreyar-abeer.shinyapps.io/shiny/"
class = "a-body" target = "_blank">first app</a> was up and running.</p>
<p>Seeing the capabilites and the promise it held, I decided that this is what I want to do.
Not to mention I got to do something that I love in the process, write R codes.</p>
<p>Coming back to the academic studies and the graduation, that wasn&rsquo;t very appealing to me.
The fact that I was able to complete it is a wonder. Praises to Allah Subhanahu
wa ta&rsquo;ala and some friends who literally pushed me through it.
The tagline would possibly be &lsquo;BSc Dropout&rsquo; otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ghareeb to wo hai jis ka koi dost na ho.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allah Subhanahu wa ta&rsquo;ala has bestowed this disobedient slave many many niyamats,
all by His Mercy and Power. I can never say enough prayers or praises in His Honor.</p>
<p>What is it that drives people?<br>
A man with a broken leg is smiling, because his team won in the final.<br>
A man with no broken legs is crying, because his team lost.<br>
What makes them do that?</p>
<p>The answer is not far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its within, happiness lies within.</p>
</blockquote>
