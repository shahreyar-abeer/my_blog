> Custom-made modules to import data into your Shiny app.




## Overview

This is an R package that provides pre-built custom shiny modules to import data from various sources
into a Shiny app.  
The modules can be used in any standard shiny app. Just plug in the `ui` and `server`
functions in the right place to make them work.  
There are four modules at the moment.  

* `import-globalenv`
* `import-file`
* `import-copypaste`  
* `import-googlesheets`

#### In Collaboration with  

This is a project funded by  <a href = "https://www.dreamrs.fr/" target="_blank" class = "a-body" style="font-weight:bold;">dreamRs: Data science with a capital R</a>. They provide 'Consulting, Expertise and Training in data science
Specialized in R'.

a mentor. This underserving minion just followed along.
