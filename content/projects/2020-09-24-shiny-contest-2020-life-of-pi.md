According to RStudio, there were 220 submissions from 183 unique Shiny developers to the contest this year. Being a part of it is an achievement in itself.  

So I came up with "Life of Pi: A Monte Carlo Simulation".  
**This is a shiny app that demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo Simulation
to estimate the value of pi.**  

The app uses <a class="a-body" href="https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html"
target="_blank">{gganimate}</a> to show how a Monte Carlo Simulation runs in real time.  
<a class="a-body" href="https://github.com/thomasp85/ggforce#:~:text=ggforce%20is%20a%20package%20aimed,0.0.&text=that%20are%20as%20well%20documented,official%20ones%20found%20in%20ggplot2%20."
target="_blank">{ggforce}</a>, <a class="a-body" href="https://waiter.john-coene.com/#/"
target="_blank">{waiter}</a> are a couple of other mentionable packages used.  
Some CSS has also been used to design the app.  

You can try it out <a class="a-body" href="https://shahreyar-abeer.shinyapps.io/life_of_pi/"

Here is the original RStudio Community <a class="a-body" href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/life-of-pi-a-monte-carlo-simulation-2020-shiny-contest-submission/59748"
target="_blank">submission</a> and the <a class="a-body" href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/07/13/winners-of-the-2nd-shiny-contest/"
target="_blank">RStudio Blog Post</a> mentioning the winners.


It was enough for me that I was able to submit something in a contest like this.  
The Honorable Mentions award was a bonus.
