People typically add their degrees after their name. It's a way to show
their achievements and they are usually proud of it. I can't say I'm different.

> Study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in.

Programming has always intrigued me. Owing to mediocre results in the admission exam,
I was not given the option to choose CSE as a major.
A teacher of mine advised me to take Statistics.
Now I see that maybe that was the best thing that happened to me.  

Blessings come in various forms. Me getting introduced to R could be one
of them. During the early days, Python was more
favorable to me. But ever since I was introduced to Shiny, R Packages & the wonderful
R community, the plot changed.  

This undeserving minion has always been favored with blessings of which he is unworthy. It was during my University days that the thought occured to me; The world that
we see is just part of it. There's more to it, a lot more. Here,
**success** is defined by degrees, position, money and stuff.  
A man is measured by these trivial things. But these things can never define man.  

> A man's measure is his will.  

Towards the end of 3rd year, I had grown quite fond of R. This is when I started working
with Shiny. After days of work, my <a href = " https://shahreyar-abeer.shinyapps.io/shiny/"
class = "a-body" target = "_blank">first app</a> was up and running.  

Seeing the capabilites and the promise it held, I decided that this is what I want to do.
Not to mention I got to do something that I love in the process, write R codes.  

Coming back to the academic studies and the graduation, that wasn't very appealing to me.
The fact that I was able to complete it is a wonder. Praises to Allah Subhanahu
wa ta'ala and some friends who literally pushed me through it.
The tagline would possibly be 'BSc Dropout' otherwise.

> Ghareeb to wo hai jis ka koi dost na ho.

Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala has bestowed this disobedient slave many many niyamats,
all by His Mercy and Power. I can never say enough prayers or praises in His Honor.  

What is it that drives people?  
A man with a broken leg is smiling, because his team won in the final.  
A man with no broken legs is crying, because his team lost.  
What makes them do that?  

The answer is not far.  
> Its within, happiness lies within.
