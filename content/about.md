People usually add their degrees after their name. It's a way to show
their achievements. I believe dropping out is one too.

Programming has always intrigued me. Owing to mediocre results in the admission exam,
I did not have the option to choose CSE as a major.
A teacher of mine advised me to take Statistics.
Now I see that maybe that was the best thing that happened to me.  

It is here where I was introduced to R. During the early days, Python was more
favorable to me. But ever since I was introduced to Shiny, R Packages & the wonderful
R community, the plot changed.  

It is during my University days that the thought occured to me; The world that
we see is just part of it. There's more to it, a lot more. Here,
**success** is defined by degrees, respect, money and stuff.
And happiness is thought to be tied to these trivial things. When in fact, its not.

> Happiness lies within  

Towards the end of 3rd year, I had grown quite fond of R. This is when I was introduced
to Shiny. After days of work, my <a href = " https://shahreyar-abeer.shinyapps.io/shiny/"
class = "a-body" target = "_blank">first app</a> was up and running.  

Seeing the capabilites and the promise it held, I decided that this is what I want to do.
Not to mention I got to do something that I love in the process, write R codes.  

Coming back to the academic studies and the graduation, that was simply boring stuff.
The fact that I was able to complete it is a wonder. Praises to Allah Subhanahu
wa ta'ala and some friends who literally pushed me through it.
The tagline would have been 'BSc Dropout' otherwise.

Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala has bestowed this disobedient slave many many niyamats,
all by His Mercy and Power. I can never say enough prayers or praises in His Honor.  

Pondering over things is a bad habit of mine. I have always been curious about
the thing that drives people.  
A man with a broken leg is smiling, because his team won in the final.  
A man with no broken legs is crying, because his team lost.  
What makes them do that?  

The answer is not far, its within.
