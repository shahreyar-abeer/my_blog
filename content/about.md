Programming has always intrigued me. Owing to my mediocre results in the admission exam,
I was not given the option to choose CSE as a major.
A well-wisher teacher advised me to take Statistics.
Now I see that maybe that was the best thing that happened to me.  

It is here where I was introduced to R. During my early days, Python was more
favorable to me. But ever since I was introduced to Shiny, R Packages & the wonderful
R community, the plot changed.  



I graduated in Statistics from University of Dhaka in 2018. The curriculam was
focused towards the 'pure' side of things, so it involved more theories than applications.
The Masters was of a similar track.   


I have always had a thing for the applied things, and I've always liked programming.
Out of my interest, I had taken the course <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/" class="a-body">Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python</a> from MIT Open Courseware. I recommend this to anyone who
say they like programming.

So after a couple of months of maze-like theories, I thought to myself
