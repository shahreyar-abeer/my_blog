<p class = "first"> Recursion. A concept that I never truly got the hang of.
I would end up with a never ending process as I couldn't define the base case
properly. A recipe for a crashed session.

This website is about R and about life. So I somehow had to include both the
themes in the title. Feel free to read it as *The way we are* if need be.
The choice is left to the reader.  


The header image is actually a *ggplot!* It is inspired by a plot from the
awesome book <a href = "http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/" class = "a-body" target = "_blank">Storytelling with data</a>.
I've simply reproduced it with R. Here is my <a href = "/blog/2020/07/12/behind-the-scenes-a-ggplot/" class = "a-body">post</a> that shows how to do that.

*So writing in R to talk about writing in R.*  
This has to be a recursion. Or is it?
