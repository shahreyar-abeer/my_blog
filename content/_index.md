<p class = "first"> Recursion. A concept that's quite difficult to get the hang of.
But one faces it a surprising number of times along the way.
Staring at the clock for a few minutes should reveal the fact.

This website is about R and about life. Integrating both the ideas in the title
was a bit challenging. Let's just hope it wasn't a complete failure. 

The logo of the website is actually a ggplot. This <a href = "/blog/2020/07/12/behind-the-scenes-a-ggplot/" class = "a-body">post</a> goes
into the details & points to the code that produced it.

*So a website about R, written in R, that has the logo made in R.*  
Can this be defined as a recursion? Maybe.

Sometimes the explanation is a bit harder to grasp than the actual concept.
