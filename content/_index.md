<p class = "first"> Recursion. A concept that I never truly got the hang of.
I would end up with a never ending process as I couldn't define the base case
properly. Which ulitmately lead to a crashed session.

This website is about R and about life. So while naming it, I
wanted to include both the themes in the title. Feel free to read it as 
*The way we are* or keep the original name. The choice is left to the reader.  


The header image is actually a *ggplot!* It is inspired by a plot from the
awesome book <a href = "http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/" class = "a-body" target = "_blank">Storytelling with data</a>.
I've simply reproduced it with R. Here is my <a href = "/blog/2020/07/12/behind-the-scenes-a-ggplot/" class = "a-body">post</a> that shows how to do that.

So a website about R, written using R. *Writing in R to say how to write in R.*  
This has to be a recursion. Or is it?

That doesn't clear things much, does it? I guess it's just the way it is.
