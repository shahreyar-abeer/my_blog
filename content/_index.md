<p class = "first"> Recursion, a concept i never truly got the hang of.
I've always had problems defining the base case and would end up with a never ending
process ulitmately crashing my session. But recursion has a tendency of coming back.

So here I am, writing a blog using R, whose contents are primarily related to R.  
Using R (actually Rstudio) to write about R, does that count as a recursion? I don't know,
what would the 'base case' be?  


Did you notice the logo-like plot on the left? (desktop/laptop users only)  
Yes, the one that comes with an entrance. It's actually a **ggplot**, inspired by the
awesome book by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, <a href = "/contact/" class = "a-body" target = "_blank">Storytelling with data</a>. In the book, it's titled the 
**"Timeline of thanks"**. The plot reveals itself in the <a href = "/about/" class = "a-body">About</a> section.
I've also written a <a href = "/blog/" class = "a-body">post</a> to show its coded.  

So a website about R, written using R, and the home page has a plot that's made in R.  
This has to be a recursion. Or is it?
